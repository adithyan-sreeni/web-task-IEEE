Okay, here is the updated markdown file incorporating the use of GSAP, specifically for scroll animations, while maintaining the other requirements like React/Vite, plain CSS, and the specified sections.

# IEEE SB CEC Landing Page (with GSAP Scroll Animations)

## Project Description

This project involves designing and developing a single-page landing website for the IEEE Student Branch, College of Engineering Chengannur (IEEE SB CEC). The website serves as a central online presence to represent the organization, highlight its activities, showcase its values, and feature member testimonials. The goal is to create a visually appealing, responsive, and easy-to-navigate site using modern web technologies, plain CSS for styling, and incorporating dynamic on-scroll animations with GSAP to enhance user engagement.

## Features

The single-page website includes the following compulsory sections and features:

*   **Hero Section:** Prominent display of the IEEE SB CEC title, a compelling tagline, and a clear Call-to-Action (CTA) button (e.g., "Join Us", "Learn More").
*   **About Section:** A concise description of the branch, outlining its history, purpose, along with its Vision, Mission, and Core Values.
*   **Latest Events Section:** Showcases 2-3 recent or representative events with details including title, date, a brief description, and optional imagery or icons.
*   **Testimonials Section:** Features quotes from members or fictional testimonials, including their name, role, and a placeholder image.
*   **Footer:** Contains essential contact information, links to official social media profiles (LinkedIn, Instagram, etc.), and a copyright notice.
*   **Responsiveness:** The layout is designed to adapt gracefully to various screen sizes, from desktops to mobile devices, using pure CSS media queries.
*   **Scroll Animations:** Implement engaging animations for elements or sections as they scroll into the viewport, using GSAP and its ScrollTrigger plugin.
*   **Plain CSS Styling:** Styling is handled entirely using standard CSS files, avoiding framework-specific utility classes.

## Tech Stack

*   **Frontend Framework:** React (using Vite for fast setup and development)
*   **Styling:** Plain CSS (`.css` files)
*   **Animation:** GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) with ScrollTrigger plugin
*   **Bundler:** Vite
*   **Language:** JavaScript (or TypeScript if preferred, but JS for simplicity based on prompt)

*Note: Tailwind CSS was explicitly excluded as per the requirements.*

## Project Structure

The project will follow a standard React application structure, with dedicated files for components and their styles. GSAP and ScrollTrigger will be imported and used within the relevant component files.

```

*   Each major section of the page will be implemented as a separate React component (`.js`).
*   Styling for each component or section will reside in dedicated CSS files within the `src/styles` directory. Global styles will be in `global.css`.
*   `App.js` will orchestrate the rendering of these components in the correct order to form the single page.
*   GSAP and ScrollTrigger will be imported and configured within the components where scroll animations are desired (e.g., animating elements within the About, Events, or Testimonials sections as they enter the viewport).

## Design Choices

*   **Visuals:** Aim for a clean, modern aesthetic, potentially incorporating the official IEEE colors (blue and gold) and branding elements.
*   **Typography:** Select readable fonts for headings and body text.
*   **Layout:** Utilize Flexbox and CSS Grid for building responsive layouts using plain CSS.
*   **Responsiveness:** Media queries in CSS will be used extensively to adjust layouts, font sizes, and element visibility for different screen sizes.
*   **Animations:** Utilize plain CSS for simple interactions like hover effects on buttons and links. **Crucially, implement sophisticated on-scroll animations for sections or key elements using GSAP and its ScrollTrigger plugin to create dynamic reveals and transitions as the user scrolls down the page.** This could include fading in elements, sliding them from the sides, or other engaging effects triggered by the scroll position.
*   **Content:** Placeholder text (Lorem Ipsum, fictional event/testimonial details) will be used initially, with notes indicating where real content should be inserted.

## Setup and Running

To run the project locally:



*Note: GSAP and ScrollTrigger will need to be imported into components where animations are applied. Remember to register ScrollTrigger: `gsap.registerPlugin(ScrollTrigger);`*

## Deployment

The website will be deployed using a free hosting service like Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages.

## Repository

The complete codebase is available in a public GitHub repository.

*(This link will be updated once the repository is created)*

## Evaluation Criteria Alignment

*   **Website Design and Responsiveness:** Focus on clean visual design using plain CSS and thorough testing across various devices.
*   **Code Quality and File Structure:** Utilize React components for modularity, maintain a clear directory structure, and write clean, readable JavaScript and CSS code. Ensure GSAP usage is organized within components.
*   **Animations:** **Specifically address the animation criteria by implementing smooth and engaging on-scroll reveal animations using GSAP and the ScrollTrigger plugin.** Basic CSS animations will be used for simpler effects like hovers.
